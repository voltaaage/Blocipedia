# Blocipedia
Blocipedia (like wikipedia) is a wiki application that was created to learn about Stripe integration and the HABTM relationship. 

## Premium Memberships
Members can upgrade their accounts by paying for a premium membership with Stripe. Once upgraded, they have the ability to: 
* Create and view private wikis
* Add other users as collaborators to wikis

_Note: As this is a project to learn about the above concepts and tools, there may be some gaps in functionality in the workflows and privacy policies. _
